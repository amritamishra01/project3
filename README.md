🤖 What Was Built Using Vercel v0 (5–10 lines)

The Hero Section layout (text + image grid structure) was generated initially using Vercel v0.

The Features Section card layout (3-column grid with icons) was also created using v0 as the base.

The Testimonials / Highlights Section outline, including card structure, was generated via v0.

The Pricing cards design (3-tier pricing boxes) was AI-generated and later customized manually.

The Footer section base layout (4-column layout + newsletter) was created with v0.

All sections generated by v0 were further refined, animated, and styled manually using Tailwind + Framer Motion.

The overall theme, gradients, animations, and responsiveness were improved beyond the v0 defaults.
